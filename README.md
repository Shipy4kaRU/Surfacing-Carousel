# CSS Carousel

A carousel implemented entirely with CSS. This project showcases the capabilities of styling and animation without the use of JavaScript, providing a smooth and visually appealing interface for displaying images or content.

I plan to add this carousel to my style library in the **gulp-build-2024** project. It is recommended to use the carousel with **fewer elements** for optimal performance, as having a large number of elements can cause the **outer elements** to function visually worse. This also depends on the **sizes of the elements**, so it's important to consider their proportions when adding them to the carousel.

Perfect for web designers and developers looking to enhance the visual aspect of their projects.
